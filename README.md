- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmyShafer
- 👀 I’m interested in engaging and memorable web design. <a href=https://amyshafer.github.io/Amy-U-Shafer-Portfolio target="_blank_">Here</a> is an example.
- 🌱 I’m currently spending time with SQL.
- 💞️ I am now collaborating on resturant database project.
- ✨ When I'm not coding, I'm reading, writing, listening to music, playing music, watching movies, fostering cats, working out to Richard Simmons, or making delicious vegan food.
